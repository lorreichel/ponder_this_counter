    "solver_text": "This puzzle is from Evan Morton. \n\r\nRecently I went on a vacation with my wife and her extended family. The dining room staff at the resort said that the 14 of us could not be seated at the same table, so they put us at two tables, of 8 and 6 seats respectively.  So I wondered, if everyone wants to sit at least once with everyone else, how many meals do we need to accomplish this?  \n\r\nWhen I say \"sit with,\" I don't mean \"sit next to\", I just mean sit at the same table.\n\r\nThis leads to a more general question.  Given any two numbers M and N, if M+N people are seated at tables of M and N respectively, how many meals does it take?\n\r\nThis is not a trick question.  At a given meal you have to sit in one seat throughout the meal, the tables do not overlap, etc.)\r\nIt turns out to be a reasonably hard problem.",

Not being familiar with such food, they do not recognize any of the names for the dishes.  Each orders one dish, not necessarily distinct.  The waiter brings the dishes and places them in the middle, without saying which is which.  At this point, they may be able to deduce some.  For example, if two people ordered the same item, and everyone else ordered different dishes, then the item of which two copies arrive must be the one of which two were ordered.\n\nThey return to the restaurant two more times, following the same drill, though with different orders.  After three meals, they have eaten all nine items on the menu, and can tell which is which.\n\nWhat pattern of ordering fulfills this?\n\nShow that the story couldn't be true if the number of items on the menu were ten instead of nine.\n\n\nWe will post the names of those who submit a correct, original solution!

If one citizen has a number which is half the number of the box, one can take an envelope with all n dollars for oneself. The group goes on to the next box and does accordingly.  The second group does likewise.\n\nFor instance, if Mr. 1200 and Mrs. 300 are in the same group, they step forward the moment their group reaches box 1500, and take an envelope of 1500 dollars.  Mr. 1200 takes 1200 dollars and Mrs 300 takes 300 dollars.

At the edge of the lake is a mean goblin who wants to eat us; and if he catches us, he will do so.  The goblin can't swim and won't go into the lake (and doesn't have a boat!) but he can run k times as fast as we can row.\n(We'll discuss the parameter k later.)\n\nWe, however, can run significantly faster than the goblin can, so if we are able to reach a point at the edge of the lake without the goblin being there, then we will be able to escape.\n\nWill we be able to escape or are our only options to be marooned forever on the lake or to be eaten by the goblin?\n\nThe answer depends on the parameter k. \nThere is a threshold T, such that if k<T then we can escape, and if k>T the goblin will eat us.

    "solver_text": "This month's challenge comes from John G. Fletcher:\n\nThere are 16 distinct binary boolean operators (or gates) that map ordered pairs of boolean operands (or inputs) into single boolean results (or outputs).  However, for present purposes two operators can be treated as the same if they differ only in that one is obtained from the other by exchanging the operands.  Since there are four such pairs of operators, there essentially are only 12 binary boolean operators.  Two of these are really the boolean constants (\"T\" and \"F\"), because the result does not depend on either operand, and two are really unary operators (\"Identity\" and \"Not\"), because the result depends on only one of the operands, while the remaining eight are truly binary (\"And\", \"Or\", \"Nand\", \"Nor\", \"Equivalent\", \"Xor\", \"Implies\", and \"Non-implies\").\n\nA (possibly improper) subset of these operators is said to be \"closed\" if and only if all compositions of operators in the set yield only operators that also are in the set.  Each closed subset includes the Identity, which is the composition of no operators at all.  Any composition is treated as a binary operator by assigning one of two independent boolean values (e.g., p or q) to each of the available operands -- e.g., [p Nand p] is [Not p]; [(p Nand p) Nand p] is T; both [(p Nand p) Nand q] and [(p Nand q) Nand q] are [q Implies p] -- so any closed set that contains \"Nand\" must also contain \"T\", \"Not\", and \"Implies\").\n\nThe question is:  How many distinct closed subsets are there, and which operators are in each?\n\nThe number of cases to be considered is sufficiently small that the answer can be obtained by \"brute force\", that is, by exhaustively considering all cases, either by hand or with a computer.  So what we prefer is a more elegant argument, one that may provide some insight into why the closed subsets are what they are and why there are no others.  Also of interest are interpretations of the restricted range of logic represented by each closed subset.\n\n\nWe will post the names of those who submit a correct, original solution!

We describe a \"Hamiltonian tour\" on these nodes: start at one node, visit each of the other N-1 nodes exactly once, and finish at the starting node.\n\nThe \"cost\" of a single link on this tour is the _square_ of the Euclidean distance between the two nodes.  (If the nodes are at distance 0.8 from each other, the cost of the link is 0.64.)\n\nNotice that these \"costs\" do not satisfy the triangle inequality. So it is important that we are forbidden to visit any node twice (except the starting node, which doubles as the ending node).\n\nThe \"cost\" of the tour is the sum of the costs of the N individual links.\n\nThe \"price\" of the constellation is the smallest \"cost\" of any Hamiltonian tour on these N nodes.\n\nWe are interested in the largest \"price\" of any constellation. We are looking for upper and lower bounds on this price. That is, supply a number U and a proof that every constetllation (regardless of N) has price at most U; and supply a number L (as large as you can), and a constellation whose price is at least L. The object is to find U and L as close together as possible.\n\nUpdate:\nSeveral readers have given the inscribed equilateral triangle as evidence that L=9. Very few have given a proof of an upper bound U independent of N. Most attempted proofs have included the following argument, which I have trouble accepting: \"The optimal tour cannot contain an obtuse angle ABC, because elimination of B will create a tour on N-1 nodes that is more expensive.\" The trouble is that this tour on N-1 nodes is not necessarily the optimal tour on those N-1 nodes; the optimal tour need not contain edge AC. So the cost of the N-1 node constellation is not necessarily larger than that of the original N node constellation.\n\n\nWe will post the names of those who submit a correct, original solution!

(For example, we are told that the two roads leading out of Pittsburgh lead to Buffalo and Erie, respectively.) Each road leads from one city to another (or possibly back to the same city).  Each city has exactly two roads leading out of it, and at least one leading in. We are assured that it is possible to proceed from any city to any other city by legal moves along the roads (that is, in the proper direction). \n\nWe must impose one other technical condition:\nDefine a \"cycle\" to be a route leading from one city through some other cities and back to the starting point (following the roads legally, and without visiting any city twice), and the \"length\" of a cycle to be the number of roads traversed. We must assume that for each prime number p there is a cycle whose length is not divisible by p. (For example, not all cycles have length divisible by 3.)\n\nOur task is to color each road red or green, so that for each city the two roads exiting that city have different colors, and so that \"universal directions\" can be given: namely, if a friend calls up and says \"I don't know where I am; how do I get to Pittsburgh?\", we can respond: \"Take the red road out of your present city, then the green road, then the next green road, then red, then green, and then red; then you will be in Pittsburgh.\"\n\nNotes:\nIt is not enough to guarantee that these universal directions lead our friend THROUGH  Pittsburgh somewhere along the line; she must END UP in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe problem: Show that (under the given assumptions) we can always color the roads so that the \"universal directions\" can be given.

    "solver_text": "The following problem is sugessted by Norbert Sepp, Kalman Sallai and Gyozo Nagy. It is closely related to 2003 August Challenge.\n\nImagine that we define new chess pieces, with new powers.  \nEach piece has an associated \"hit matrix\" with 15 columns and 15 rows.\nFor example the following matrix defines the traditional rook.\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 R 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTo interpret this matrix: if the rook were at the center (labelled \"R\"), any piece at a square labelled \"1\" would be attacked by the rook, \nbut  a piece at a square labelled \"0\" would not be attacked.\nTo decide whether a rook attacks a square on an 8 by 8 chessboard, we superimpose the chessboard on this matrix so that the rook is on the \"R\",\nand look at the corresponding square.\nIn that sense a rook's power is independent of position: if a rook at a4  attacks a piece two squares to the right, then a rook at b7 also attacks a piece two square to the right.\n\nWith that in mind, we can define a new chess piece by writing such a 15 by 15 matrix of 0's and 1's (with the piece at the center).\nIn fact we can define 2^224 different kinds of piece.  (Of the 225 entries in the matrix, only the central one is irrelevant.)\n\nFor each such chess piece, we define its \"value\" as follows: \nGiven a piece of type F,  suppose that the largest number of such pieces that can be placed on the 8x8 board without attacking each other, is k.\nThen a piece of type F has value 1/k.\n\nOur goal is to define a number of new pieces, and place them on the 8x8 board without attacking each other.\nWe want to maximize the total value of the pieces on the board.\n\nAn example follows:\n\nDefine a piece F by the matrix \n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 F 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSuch a piece F can attack anything in any column to its right, or anything above it on its own column. \nIts value is 1, since no two F pieces can be placed on the board without one attacking the other.\n\nSimilarly define G by \n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 G 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nG also has value 1.\n\nThen the  following 8x8 board would have value 2.75 = (6/8) + (1) + (1).  It has one each of the new G and F pieces, along with 6 rooks (value=1/8).\n\nG 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 R 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 R 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 R 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 R 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 R 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 R 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 F\n\nTo save time and space, this board could be abbreviated as follows:\n\nValue = 2.75\n\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\nThat is, an 8 by 8 array of integers, with 0 denoting an empty square, and a positive integer k denoting a piece with value 1/k (because a maximum of k copies of  that particular piece could be placed on the board).  \n\nProblem: design a collection of pieces, place them on the board, obtain a value larger than 20, and send to us the value and the 8x8 board in the format shown above (in red); that is, only the value and the 8 by 8 array of integers.

He has long given up on trying to label these cassettes with any meaningful names.  Now he just numbers them. The numbers go from 1 up and are consecutive.\n\nIn order to label the cassettes, he uses the digit stickers that come with a bought cassette.  Each cassette comes with one sticker for each digit.\n\nSo, for example, to label the first cassette, he uses just the sticker \"1\" and keeps the rest.  To label the second, he uses just the sticker \"2\" and keeps the rest.  To label the tenth, he uses two stickers, one \"1\" and one \"0\", and keeps the rest.  To label the eleventh, he uses one \"1\" sticker from the stickers he just got, and one \"1\" sticker which he had in stock from the previous ten.  And so on.\n\nThe question is, what is the number of the first cassette which he will no longer be able to label in this way (i.e., that will deplete his stock of stickers to the point that he will not be able to form the desired number)? Please give your answer for general B, as well as for B=10. Please supply a proof if posssible.\n\nIn order to make the question interesting (and avoid simple programmatic solutions), the solver should give a closed formula for the number as a function of B, where B is the base in which my friend counts (assume that the cassettes come with one sticker for each digit of the base used).  So, for example, if my friend chooses to count in hexadecimal, this is because each cassette comes with 16 stickers, that are \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", ... , \"F\").  The closed formula need only work for B's that are even numbers, such as decimal, octal, hexadecimal and binary.  I am not aware of the existence of a closed formula for the odd numbered bases.\n\nAs usual, preference is given to closed-form solutions (no recursion, no sums).

It is similar to our November 2002 puzzle (from Martin Gardner's February 1979 Scientific American column), but with an important difference. To be considered for publication, please supply answers for BOTH parts of the puzzle.\n\nPart 1:\nThere is a round table divided into 4 equal quadrants, with one cup in each quadrant.  The quadrants are labeled with letters (A, B, C, D) that do not move.  Initially, each cup is randomly face-up or face-down.  You are blindfolded and put in front of the table.  On each turn of the game, you instruct a genie to flip the cups in whichever positions you choose (e.g., you may say \"flip the cups in A and B\"), possibly choosing no cups or possibly all four. The genie complies.  At this point, if all the cups on the table are face-up, the genie will tell you that you have won the game and are free to go.  If not, he rotates the cups randomly (possibly not rotating them) and you play another turn.  Give a strategy to win this game in a finite number of moves (the solution is not unique).\n\nRemark: the outcome of \"rotation\" the four cups is one of the four possible positions: the cups originally at (A,B,C,D) can be at (A,B,C,D), (B,C,D,A), (C,D,A,B), or (D,A,B,C). It is not an arbitrary permutation.\n\nNotice that you cannot examine the current orientation of any cup at any time.  This contrasts with the earlier puzzle.\n\nPart 2:\nSuppose that instead of 4, there are n divisions and cups.  For which n is it possible to guarantee a win?

It was inspired by a request made one day that I come home immediately to do my chores, whereupon I would start walking home at a constant pace (I wasn't one to disobey), but I would try to find the longest possible route home (so as to put off doing my chores).  Of course, I couldn't really walk in the opposite direction and claim to be \"walking home.\" So I thought of the following problem:\n\nPart 1:\nPoints A and B are on a plane surface, 1 mile apart.  Suppose you must walk in a path consisting of N straight lines from point A to point B, such that at all times your (Euclidean) distance to point B is decreasing.  What is the longest possible route length (as a function of N)?\n\nPart 2:\nSuppose the house is due north of the starting point, and on the way home, I always turn left (by less than 180 degrees). I still take a longest path according to the rules of Part 1.  On the last leg of this longest path, I'm walking both northward and eastward (mostly eastward). What's the smallest possible value of N?\n\nAnd of course your puzzlemaster has to add a \"Part 3\":\nSuppose that in the setup of part 1, we have N=3; point A is 1 mile due east of point B; and the path is subject to the additional constraint that the last (third) line must be directed due south.

We have an unknown vector V of length N of integers between 0 and K-1 inclusive. During each move, we propose another vector W of length N, of integers between 0 and K-1. A genie selects a secret integer J between 0 and N-1 and rotates W by J positions: Rot(W,J) is the last N-J entries of W, followed by the first J entries of W. The genie then replaces V by (V + Rot(W,J))(mod K). If the new value of V is all 0, we win; otherwise we continue to play.\n\nPart 1 (from Joe Fendel):\nFor what pairs of integers (N,K) is there a fixed finite sequence of moves (a sequence of vectors W) such that if we apply this sequence in order, we are guaranteed to win by the time the sequence is finished? Prove that these pairs admit such a sequence, and that no other pairs do.\n\nPart 2 (from Dan Dima):\nFix K=2. For each N, there is a largest integer M such that we can produce a sequence of vectors W and guarantee that if we apply this sequence in order, we will guarantee that on one of the moves, at least M elements of V are zero.

If we can test any number of parts at once (learning whether they are all good or at least one is defective) then it is well known that a binary search will identify a defective part after log2(n) tests.  \n\nThis month's puzzle concerns a variation on this problem in which the defective part only fails intermittently.  Assume when the bad part is tested (by itself or with other parts) it fails half the time and passes half the time.  The following questions concern how many tests on average it takes various algorithms to identify a single defective part out of a large number n.  \n\nYou should ignore any lower order terms arising from the fact that you can only test integral numbers of parts at once.  Express the answers as Clog2(n) where C is a constant given to 4 decimal places (ie 1.0000 for the original problem).\n\nSuppose we use the following algorithm.  Select a subgroup of size .5n at random and test it.  If it passes repeat with different random subgroups of size .5n until you find a subgroup which fails.  Then recursively apply the algorithm to smaller groups until you have isolated the bad part.  How many tests on average will this take?\nUse the algorithm in 1) except you test random subgroups of size an instead of .5n.  What is the optimal value of a and how many tests on average will be required?\nDivide the parts at random into 2 equal subgroups and test them alternatively until one fails.  Then apply the algorithm recursively.  How many tests on average will be required to isolate the bad part.\nSame as 3) except at each stage the parts are divided into 3 equal subgroups which are tested in turn until one fails. Again how many tests on average will be needed to find the bad part?\n(Not required for credit) The algorithm in 4 is pretty good but not optimal.

Finally, the casino provides its bet.\nIf all three bets are equal - Alice & Bob win; otherwise, the casino wins.\nAlice and Bob can coordinate their strategy in advance, but once the games starts, they may not talk to one another or pass information in any way other than by announcing their bets.\nSince the casino could easily cheat and always win by deciding its bet only after Alice and Bob announce their guesses, the casino must actually determine all its bets in advance and keep them in a safe from which they are drawn..\nIt is easy to see that the casino wins 75% of the time if Alice and Bob play at random, but they can get to 50% by agreeing that Alice will play at random and Bob will copy her. In both cases, Alice and Bob might, in the worst case, lose all the time (indeed with negligible probability, but still a nonzero one).\n\nNow comes the interesting twist: Just before the beginning of the game, Bob steals the secret casino sequence from the casino's safe.\nHe knows he is going to get the secret Casino bets, but once he touches it - he can not talk to Alice anymore.\nNow they can get 50% chance of winning, for example, by letting Alice play at random and having Bob play the secret casino bet.\nThis way, however, they still might (in the worst case) lose all the bets.\nThey can, however, guarantee 50% winning by letting Alice repeat Bob's previous bet, and letting Bob play the right bet in the even rounds and the future bet in the odd rounds.\n\nWhat we ask this month is to provide Bob's strategy from n=9 rounds of the game that guarantees that Alice & Bob will win at least m=6 times.\nPlease provide the answer as a list of 512 lines of nine bits. In each line, write Bob's bets for the specific nine bets of the casino.\nFor example, here is the answer for the same question with n=2 and m=1:\n00\n11\n00\n11\nThis answer implements the strategy mentioned above.\nAs a bonus question: when n goes to infinity, can they do better?

We consider every employee to be connected to herself, so if every one of an employee's connections has a lower ID number than herself, that employee will be sending a self-addressed Christmas present.\nThe question:\nFind a connected graph of LinkedIn connections (with more than a single employee) for which, averaging over a random order of IDs, this game ends up with at least 9/16 of the employees receiving gifts. (Bonus for getting higher results.)\nSupply your answer as an adjacency matrix, i.e., a table of bits where the j'th bit in the i'th line is 1 if and only if i is connected to j.\nFor example, the following matrix\n1111\n1110\n1110\n1001\ncorresponds to a connections graph in which the first three people are connected to each other and the fourth is only connected to the first.

The names of the letters are of different lengths, from short two-letter names like mu or pi through the seven letters in omicron.\n\nWe want to generate a random Greek letter, where the probability of a letter is determined by the length of its name, and the following:\nPsi is a special case with a probability of zero (we are actually generating one of 23 letters)\nLetters whose names are composed of an even number of letters have a probability of 2^length times the probability of the letter Tau\nAll the other letters (except Psi and Tau) have a probability of 2^(length-2) times the probability of Tau\nSo, for example, the letter mu (with a length of two letters) should appear 2^2 = 4 times more than tau. Omicron (with a length of seven letters) should appear 2^(7-2), or 32 times more often than tau.\n\nThe task is to generate the random Greek letter using six coin tosses, in which the coins are chosen from two types: one with a probability of p_1 of getting a tails and 1-p_1 of getting heads; and the other with a probability of p_2 for tails and 1-p_2 for heads.\n\nYou should give p_1, p_2, and the tosses in the following format:\n<Coin>=1 or 2\n<Greek letter>=alpha or beta or gamma or delta or epsilon or zeta or eta or theta or iota or kappa or lambda or mu or nu or xi or omicron or pi or rho or sigma or tau or upsilon or phi or chi or omega\n<solution>= <Greek letter> or <coin> <solution> <solution>\n\nFor example, the following solution (the parenthesis were added just for clarity):\np_1 = 1/2\np_2 = 1/4\n1 (2 alpha (1 beta gamma)) beta\n\nWe toss the first coin p_1\n    \tIf it's tails, we toss the second coin\n        \t\tIf it's tails\n            \t\t\tWe generate alpha\n        \t\tOtherwise\n            \t\t\tWe toss p_1 and\n                \t\t\t\tIf it's tails\n                    \t\t\t\t\tWe chose beta\n                \t\t\t\tOtherwise\n                    \t\t\t\t\tWe chose gamma\n    \tOtherwise\n        \t\tWe chose beta\nUsing the schema above yields:\nAlpha: 1/8\nBeta: 11/16 (= 3/16 + 1/2)\nGamma: 3/16\nCredit for the source of this problem will be provided in the solution.\n\n\nWe will post the names of those who submit a correct, original solution!

A player whose turn starts at a LOSE position loses; starting at a WIN position wins; otherwise a move is made and the turn passed to the other player.\r\nA winning position is one where the current player can force a win (in one or more steps) by playing correctly; a losing position is a non-winning position. For example, in the default rules, (0,7,7) is a winning position, since the player can remove 7 coins from the two non-empty piles; (0,1,2) is a losing position since the possible moves result in the positions (0,1,1), (0,0,1) or (0,0,2) which are all winning (so if Alice starts in (0,1,2) Bob wins in the next move).",
